# How to Update the Auth Token

This token is needed in order for the application to connect to your Twitch account, the issue is that it expires after 60 days of requesting it. In order to get a new token, you have to send the following GET request (put it on your browser's URL bar):

```
https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
    ?client_id=<copy from Twitch API site>
    &redirect_uri=<also from Twitch API site>
    &response_type=token
    &scope=channel:moderate+chat:edit+chat:read
```

You will get a prompt to authenticate. After authenticating, you will find your new token in the new URL.

Copy this new token and voil√†.

# The right way of doing it - Refresh Token

I currently don't follow this approach, but it is a way to avoid having to manually update the token every 60 days.
